Processing can be done in two different ways. 
The first way is based on possibly given initial transformations or on a default setting. 
The user must apply the ICP algorithm with keys on the keyboard. Each image must be checked/processed individually. 
In the second way, the algorithm can do this automatically. The user still has to manually set the translation in the 
first image and then the ICP algorithm proceeds. The refinement of the ICP algorithm is done automatically. 
In this method, the pose of the object should not differ too much between 2 consecutive images (in other words a video is best). 
In addition, the user can still process the images himself. 

The controls for both methods are the same. 


ICP algorithm: 
'a': coarse ICP - 10.0 * voxel_size
'z': medium ICP - 5.0 * voxel_size
'e': fine  ICP  - 2.0 * voxel_size
'r': very fine  - 1.0 * voxel_size

Settings:
'n': next image 
'p': previous
'c': Changing the rotation steps from coarse to fine or vice versa 
     Changing the translation steps from negative to positive or vice versa 

Rotation:
'1' and '4': rotation roll axis
'2' and '5': rotation pitch axis
'3' and '6': ratation yaw axis

Translation:
'7': translation x axis  
'8': translation y axis  
'9': translation z axis  

In addition, here are two methods for creating mask images. The first method is by projecting the 3D model onto a binary image. 
This does not take occlusions into account. The second method works the same way but does so in a depth image and 
reads in the actual depth image. When the distance between the two depth images is less than a certain threshold the object is visible.
