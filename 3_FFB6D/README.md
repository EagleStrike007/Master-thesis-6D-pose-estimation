After a literature study around 6D object pose estimation algorithms and challenges of these in Huamn-Robot Collaboration, an algorithm called [FFB6D](https://github.com/ethnhe/FFB6D). FFB6D stands for "**F**ull **F**low **B**idirectional Fusion Network for **6D** Pose Estimation". At the representation learning stage of FFB6D, bidirectional fusion modules are build in the full flow of the two networks. Here fusion is applied to each encoding and decoding layer. This makes it possible that the two networks can exchange information between each other. FFB6D works on the basis of estimating the position of pre-selected keypoints. A simple 3D keypoints selection algorithm considering the texture and geometry information of objects comes along with FFB6D, which simplifies keypoint localization for the pose estimation.
