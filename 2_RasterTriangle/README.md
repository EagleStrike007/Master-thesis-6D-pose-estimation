[RasterTraingle](https://github.com/ethnhe/raster_triangle) is a non-photorealtic rendering software created by the creators of FFB6D. It is a simple renderer for synthesis data with as input a mesh and poses, and as output the rendered RGB image, depth image, mask image and annotations. Each set of images (RGB, depth and mask) along with their annotation are stored in a .pkl-file. RasterTriangle can create two types of data named *Rendered* and *Fused*.
